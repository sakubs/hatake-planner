# hatake-planner
A tool for high-intensity garden planning.

This project is still in planning. I have been thinking about it for a very long time now. I have not yet decided to whether to go desktop or web-based yet. Maybe both: online with offline capability is probably a good idea because internet service can sometimes be an issue in the fields. Mobile integration is another future probability.

Background
----------

I grow vegetables in Tohoku Japan. Managing the planning, and tracking of everything when you grow many things really get's diffictult. I learn more and more every year that I grow, so gathering data, and processing that data is something I would like to utilize for future planning.
