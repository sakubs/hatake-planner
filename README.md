# smart-hatake
A scalable tool for high-intensity garden management.


Background
----------

I grow vegetables in Tohoku Japan. Managing the planning, and tracking of everything when you grow many things really get's diffictult. I learn more and more every year that I grow, so gathering data, and processing that data is something I would like to utilize for future planning.

Many farmers in my area are elderly (I will be too before I know it) and have mobility problems. My motivation for building a smart farming system is to make growing food and managing a garden easier.

I am integrating smart tools into my garden such as automated watering systems and pest control, things like these would be great to manage from the same interface. 

hatake means garden in Japanese. I am building a smart-garden, which will integrate hardware and software to make managing a garden of any size a much simpler affair.


Features
--------

* Online, offline modes.
* Japanese/English support.
* Simple/Intuitive interface.
* Integration with sensors and Iot devices.
* Data collection and analysis.


Design Constraints
------------------

This project is still in planning. I have been thinking about it for a very long time now. I have not yet decided to whether to go desktop or web-based yet. Maybe both: online with offline capability is probably a good idea because internet service can sometimes be an issue in the fields. Mobile integration is another future probability. I will layout some design contraints for now.

1. Every feature of this software interface needs to be accessible in Japanese. English is second priority, and any other languages come last.

2. This software needs to be accessible to elderly Japanese. Interfaces must be so simple my Japanese great grandmother could use it.
