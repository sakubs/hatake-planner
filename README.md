# smart-hatake
A simple, scalable tool for garden management.

Currently this readme is more of a design doc. This project is still in planning, but I have been thinking about it for a very long time now.

Similar to a smart home system, a server (old laptop or raspberry pi) that relays messages and holds data, or optionally use cloud services will be required to build this. Although sometimes with remote locations internet service and wifi can be an issue. Local hardware is better for this reason.

Background
==========

I grow vegetables in Tohoku Japan. Planning layouts, and keeping tracking of everything when you grow many things really gets difficult. I learn more and more every year that I grow, so gathering data, and processing that data is something I would like to utilize for future planning.

Many farmers in my area are elderly (I will be too before I know it) and have mobility problems. My motivation for building a smart farming system is to make growing food and managing a garden easier.

I also integrate smart tools into my garden such as automated watering systems and pest control robots, things like these would be great to manage from the same interface. 

hatake means garden in Japanese. I am building a smart-garden for the future, which will integrate hardware and software to make managing a garden of any size a much simpler affair.

Water and resource management becomes more important every year, and people are living longer so we need smarter farms for the coming future.


Features
========

Must Have:
* Must have Japanese and English support.
* The interfacing must be simple and intuitive enough for elderly use.
* The option to integrate with remote sensors and Iot devices is necessary.
* Data collection and analysis.
* Track experiments.
 
Would be nice to have:
* Data sharing and collaboration between users.
* AI that can point out patterns that might be missed or hard to find.
* Tracking for returns on investments.

Design Constraints
==================

1. Every feature of this software interface needs to be accessible in Japanese. English is second priority, and any other languages come last. Ideally, in the end, I would love for this to become universally available in as many languages as possible.

2. This software needs to be accessible to elderly Japanese. Interfaces must be so simple my Japanese great grandmother could use it.


Contributing
============

People are living longer, sustainable practices are becoming more popular, resources must be conserved, and growing food is one of the most valuable skills on the planet so if you like my vision and want to help me get it done, I welcome contributors.
