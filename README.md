# smart-hatake
A scalable tool for high-intensity garden management.

Currently this readme is more of a design doc. This project is still in planning, but I have been thinking about it for a very long time now.

I am leaning towards this project following the same model as a smart home system. A server (old laptop or raspberry pi) that relays messages and holds data, or optionally use cloud services. Although sometimes with remote locations internet service and wifi can be an issue. Local hardware is better for this reason.


Background
----------

I grow vegetables in Tohoku Japan. Planning layouts, and keeping tracking of everything when you grow many things really gets difficult. I learn more and more every year that I grow, so gathering data, and processing that data is something I would like to utilize for future planning.

Many farmers in my area are elderly (I will be too before I know it) and have mobility problems. My motivation for building a smart farming system is to make growing food and managing a garden easier.

I also integrate smart tools into my garden such as automated watering systems and pest control, things like these would be great to manage from the same interface. 

hatake means garden in Japanese. I am building a smart-garden, which will integrate hardware and software to make managing a garden of any size a much simpler affair.


Features
--------

Must Have:
* Must have Japanese and English support.
* The interfacing must be simple and intuitive enough for elderly use.
* The option to integrate with remote sensors and Iot devices is necessary.
* Data collection and analysis.
 
Would be nice to have:
* Data sharing and collaboration between users.


Design Constraints
------------------

1. Every feature of this software interface needs to be accessible in Japanese. English is second priority, and any other languages come last.

2. This software needs to be accessible to elderly Japanese. Interfaces must be so simple my Japanese great grandmother could use it.
